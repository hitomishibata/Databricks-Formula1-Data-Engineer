# Introduction

Hello everyone! Thank you for visiting my repository.
In this data ETL (extract, transform, and load) process project, I created Databricks notebooks to prepare the Formula1 data for data analytics. I mostly followed the assignments from the Udemy course, Azure Databricks & Spark For Data Engineers (PySpark / SQL). I changed some parts to make it more challenging (e.g., adding look-up file)
